> Demonstration of K-Means Clustering and Decision Trees for analysing custom Spotify Playlist

## Usage

UPDATE: Added a Presentation Version of the Notebook, with Dataset stored in pickle file.
This could be used without needing to set up Spotify API at all.

Make a `.env` file with the following environment variables for using Spotify API -

- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
- SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI

`Spotipy` package reads these environment variables and fetches required playlist data
